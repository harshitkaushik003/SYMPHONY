# Symphony v0.01
Symphony is a computer vision based project that allows you to play music through leg gestures using ArucoMarkers.

## Overview:
* We use OpenCV and ArucoMarkers for detecting the markers that have been placed on the floor, the marker size is kept after taking in consideration the average shoe size of the partcipants so as to avoid any errors whilel detecting the markers.
* After the detection of the marker is done, the next challenge we face is how to produce the sounds used in the game. We tackle this problem by using boolean expresions in the conditional statements
